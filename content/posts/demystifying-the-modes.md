When learning how to play modally, I devised a system to dramatically reduce the amount of things I had to memorize. To improvise 
successfully, you must first learn where every note in the current key falls on your fretboard. This can be done with 3 shapes. 

[![F major](/img/f-major.png)](/fretboard/?scale=f+major&accidentals=flats&startFret=1&endFret=14)

The diagram above shows a fretboard with every note in the key of `F` major highlighted. The three shapes you want to learn are between 
frets [**1 and 5**](/fretboard/?startFret=1&endFret=5&scale=f+major&accidentals=flats), 
frets [**6 and 10**](/fretboard/?startFret=6&endFret=10&scale=f+major&accidentals=flats), and 
frets [**10 and 14**](/fretboard/?startFret=10&endFret=14&scale=f+major&accidentals=flats). 
Pay attention to whether or not one shape connects to the next. The shapes move with eachother depending on the key.

### Applying the shapes modally
So, how does knowing how to play the major scale help with playing modally? Essentially, every major scale is also 6 other modal scales. 
All you need to do is change which note you consider to be the tonic. If you take shape one from the diagram above and start it from the second 
note, you'll be playing `G` dorian. The third note, and you're playing `A` phrygian. These are called 'relative' scales. They contain the same 
notes, just in different orders.

>This diagram shows the interval sequence for each of the modes. As you can see, they are each the same sequence starting from a different point. 

It's possible to essentially reverse engineer any modal scale and find out which major scale it relates to. Because you now know how to play the 
major scale across the entire fretboard, you can also play any modal scale. `"I don't particularly like modes a lot"` is a mnemonic that helps with 
correctly remembering the order of the modes.

### Figuring out the relative major
You will need to be able to find any note on both the `E` and `A` strings. Use my [**fretboard visualizer**](/fretboard) to help with this. 
`"Eggs & Bacon"` is a helpful mnemonic for remembering which notes don't have sharps (`E` and `B`).

Within the first shape, take note of which string each note ends up on. For example, the 4th note is on the `A` string. The 7th is on the 
`D` string, etc. Let's walk through some examples of 'reverse-engineering' this shape. 

We want to find the relative Lydian of `C#` Mixolydian. Our steps would be: 
1) Mixolydian is the 5th mode. The 5th note in our first shape is on the `A` string, so we start by finding `C#` on the `A` string (fret 4). 
2) Now, we find where shape one should be placed. `C#` needs to be the 5th note we play, which means we need to start on `F#` (fret 2). 
3) Now that we've found the relative major, we need to figure out what the 4th note in that scale is, as Lydian is the 4th mode. 
4) Playing through the shape brings us to `B`, our final answer.  

### The standard approach
Typically, modes are described as modifications to the major or minor scale with the same root. If you take a major scale and sharpen the 4th, it 
becomes lydian. A minor scale with a sharpened 6th becomes dorian. Each mode has either a major or minor quality, and is considered a to be a modified 
version of the respective scale. 

This approach can offer more insight into why the modes sound the way they do, but can complicate their utilization. Having to remember where each scale
degree lies across the entire fretboard can be difficult, particularly when actively improvising. My approach is more practical, allowing you to use the 
modes effectively without needing to remember everything about each one. 

### Practice utility
I've thrown together a [**minigame**](/scale-game) you can play to test yourself. I suggest doing this with a guitar in your hands. Using the steps listed 
above, try to see how many you can get right in a row. For help, refer to my [**scale lookup**](/scale-lookup) utility
