When learning how to play modally, I devised a system to dramatically reduce the amount of things I had to memorize. To improvise 
successfully, you must first learn where every note in the current key falls on your fretboard. This can be done with 3 shapes. 

[![F major](/img/demystifying-the-modes/f-major.png)](/fretboard/?scale=f+major)

The diagram above shows a fretboard with every note in the key of F major highlighted. The three shapes you want to learn are between 
frets [**1 and 5**](/fretboard/?startFret=1&endFret=5&scale=f+major), 
frets [**6 and 10**](/fretboard/?startFret=6&endFret=10&scale=f+major), and 
frets [**10 and 14**](/fretboard/?startFret=10&endFret=14&scale=f+major). 
Pay attention to whether or not one shape connects to the next. The shapes move with eachother depending on the key.

### Applying the shapes modally
So, how does knowing how to play the major scale help with playing modally? Essentially, every major scale is also 6 other modal scales. 
All you need to do is change which note you consider to be the tonic. If you take shape one from the diagram above and start it from the 2nd 
note, you'll be playing `G` dorian. The third note, and you're playing `A` phrygian. These are called 'relative' scales. They contain the same 
notes, just in different orders.

It's possible to essentially reverse engineer any modal scale and find out which major scale it relates to. Because you now know how to play the 
major scale across the entire fretboard, you can also play any modal scale. `"I don't particularly like modes a lot"` is a mnemonic that helps with 
correctly remembering the order of the modes.

### Figuring out the relative major
You will need to be able to find any note on both the `E` and `A` strings. Use my [**fretboard visualizer**](/fretboard) to help with this. 
`"Eggs and Bacon"` is a helpful mnemonic for remembering which notes don't have sharps.

The first shape mentioned above will help you find the relative major. For example, say we're looking for the relative major of `D` mixolydian. 
Mixolydian is the fifth mode, and the fifth note of that first shape lands on the `A` string. We need to find the note `D` on the `A` string, and 
position that first shape such that `D` ends up being the fifth note we play. `D` is on the fifth fret of the `A` string, which is the fifth note
played when that shape starts on the third fret of the `E` string. That note is `G`, so the relative major is `G`. 

You can see this if you look at [**G major**](/fretboard/?scale=g+major&startFret=3&endFret=7) 
and [**D mixolydian**](/fretboard/?scale=d+mixolydian&startFret=3&endFret=7) on the visualizer. The only difference is which note is considered 
to be the root. 

### Practice utility
I've thrown together a [**minigame**](/relative-scales) you can play to test yourself. I suggest doing this with a guitar in your hands first, 
and then eventually without one. Don't expect to understand this concept immediately, instead take your time getting familiar with it and practice.
