If you're attempting to get to grips with modal playing, I'll assume you're able to play two octaves 
of any major scale. Ideally, you should be able to play every note across the entire fretboard for 
every major scale. This can be achieved with a series of shapes, not too dissimilar to the standard 
approach for learning the positions of the minor pentatonic scale.
