You need to learn scales across the entire fretboard before you can articulate any ideas you may have.
It's true that there are no right answers when it comes to music, but you must first learn how to play 
'inside' if you want to play 'outside' successfully.

Before you attempt to play modally, you must know the major scale across the entire fretboard. This can 
be done by memorizing three shapes. 

![F major](/img/demystifying-the-modes/f-major.png)

This diagram shows a fretboard with every note in the key of F major highlighted. The three shapes you 
want to learn are between 
frets [1 and 5](/fretboard/?startFret=1&endFret=5&scale=f+major), 
frets [6 and 10](/fretboard/?startFret=6&endFret=10&scale=f+major), and 
frets [10 and 14](/fretboard/?startFret=10&endFret=14&scale=f+major). 
Notice that the first shape is _not_ connected to the second shape, but the second shape _is_ connected to 
the third. After the 12th fret, the pattern repeats. If the shapes are played from top to bottom, you will 
run into certain spots where you end up playing the same note twice. This is fine, as we want to know where 
every available note is.

This approach to memorizing the major scale is essentially identical to how people generally learn 
every position of the minor pentatonic scale. The only difference is that in this case, you learn 3 
shapes rather than 5. 

Once you've memorized these shapes, you need to wrap your head around the relationship between the major 
scale and its modes. 

## What are the modes?

> "**I don't particularly like modes a lot**" - A useful mnemonic device for memorizing the order of the modes.

There are seven modes of the major scale, one for each of its notes. These modes are:
1. Ionian 
2. Dorian
3. Phrygian
4. Lydian
5. Mixolydian
6. Aeolian 
7. Locrian

Remembering them in this specific order is critically important. Ionian is the unchanged major scale, which 
you should now know how to play all across the fretboard. The other modes are all just slight modifications 
to the major scale. Conveniently, it's entirely possible to play modally without even knowing which notes 
have been modified. 

### The standard learning process
Typically, people will be taught which notes have been modified for each mode. Lydian will be thought of as 
a major scale with a sharpened 4th. The `F` in [C major](/fretboard/?scale=c+major) becomes an `F#` in 
[C lydian](/fretboard/?scale=c+lydian). This seems simple enough, until you start trying to apply this rule
across the entire fretboard every time you come across that modified tone.

You will eventually have to learn 7 totally different fretboards, or at least 7 alternate versions of the 
shapes you used to memorize the major scale. This is unreasonable and unnecessary. You need only understand 
where the modes come from to know why. 

### My approach
The modes should be remembered in a particular order for a very good reason. Take the scale `G` major for 
example. It's notes are `G A B C D E F#`. There are 6 other scales, each of a different mode, that share the 
exact same notes as G major. These are known as "relative" scales. 

The second note in `G` major is `A`, and the 2nd mode is dorian. `A` dorian shares all of `G` major's notes. 
The third note is `B`, the third mode is phrygian, and the same idea applies. Follow that same principal, and 
try entering each scale into my [visualizer](/fretboard) to see exactly what I mean. You'll notice that none 
of the notes on the fretboard actually move, only which note is highlighted as the root.
