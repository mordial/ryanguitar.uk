>"It's so important to listen to music, to listen again and again. Eat, sleep and drink music." - Arturo Sandoval

I'm guilty of saying "everything" when someone asks me what kind of music I listen to. My music taste has been heavily 
influenced by the guitar. I listen mostly to very guitar-driven music, including a lot of instrumental stuff. Check out 
my collection [**on Discogs**](https://www.discogs.com/user/rkavanagh/collection). Here are some bands I suggest you check out: 

### TTNG
"This Town Needs Guns" is a British math rock band from Oxford. Their sparkly guitar tones and constantly changing time 
signatures are what initially drew me in. I've known about these guys since 2018 or so, initially finding them through Spotify
autoplay, and have spent long nights figuring out how to play a few of their songs. Animals is my favourite album of theirs.

### Delta Sleep
Another British math rock band, Delta Sleep formed initially in Canterbury. They're another band I found through Spotify autoplay 
around 2017 or so. I've seen them live a good few times, and highly recommend essentially all of their albums. Their newest record
"Blue Garden" didn't really do it for me, but everything else is pretty fantastic.

### Snooze 
A small progressive/math rock band from Chicago. Their stuff is really really good. Their album "Still" is packed with very cool
riffs and rhythmic ideas.

### Feed Me Jack
Feed Me Jack were an indie rock band, originally from Santa Cruz. They feel very math rocky to me, with most of their music being 
heavily driven by complex guitar riffs layered on top of eachother. It looks like I'll probably never be able to see these guys live, 
unless they miraculously reform for a European tour. All of their records are fantastic, I suggest checking out Ultra Ego.

### Car bomb 
Car Bomb is a mathcore band from New York. They're towards the heavier side of music I regularly listen to, actually topping my Spotify wrapped
3 years back to back. This is one of those bands I don't usually talk about very often, given their abrasive nature. They employ rapid time signature
changes and plenty of metric modulation to an almost dizzying degree. All of their albums are amazing.

### Meshuggah
Meshuggah is a Swedish "extreme metal" band. They've been around for a long time, and create music that I think is more accurately described as 
"groove metal". They have a very particular sound, combining guest/host time signatures across different instruments to achieve the "groove" 
previously mentioned. They dethroned Car Bomb this year as my most listened-to band. Check out the two song combo "In Death - Is Life" and 
"In Death - Is Death".

### The Contortionist
The Contortionist is an American prog metal banned formed in Indiana. Their album "Language" was my favourite album for a very long time, and 
the first vinyl record I ever bought (before I even owned a turntable). Check out their 3 most recent albums.

### Satyr 
These guys are an American progressive/hardcore band from Atlanta. Check them out if you're fine with scream vocals, odd time signatures and 
weird note groupings.
