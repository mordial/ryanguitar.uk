Every scale has 6 other scales that can be considered "relative" to it. This means they all contain 
the same notes, just ordered differently. This concept is extremely useful when improvising, and can
allow you to intelligently reuse shapes and phrases across different keys and modes.

## The Minor Pentatonic Scale
The first time this concept appears for most guitarists is when learning to use the minor pentatonic 
scale to improvise in a major key. 

A guitarist will typically be taught to place 5 pentatonic boxes on the fretboard relative to the tonic. 
When playing in a minor key, this is trivial. The first box starts directly on the tonic, and each other
shape is connected sequentially. 

When improvising in a major key, the same shapes can be used. After finding the tonic as usual, simply 
move each shape back 3 frets. Shape 1 would start on the 2nd fret if playing in A major, for example. 
This works because of relative scales. 

Fret 2 of the E string is the note F#, which is the relative minor of A major. Each of these scales 
contain the same notes, just ordered differently. As a result, their notes fall onto the fretboard in 
the exact same way. Hence, the same minor pentatonic boxes can be used.

## Modes of the Major Scale 
This concept extends to every mode of the major scale. For each major scale, every note corresponds to
the root of a modal scale with the same notes. Refer to the above diagram for the correct order. Every 
relative scale for C major would be: 
- C ionian (major)
- D dorian 
- E phrygian 
- F lydian
- G mixolydian
- A aeolian (natural minor) 
- B locrian

To apply this to improvisation, one would need to learn positions of the major scale across the entire 
fretboard, how to place those positions for differing root notes, and then figure out which modal keys 
correspond with the same notes. 

Using the above list as an example, find an F lydian backing track. Because F lydian is relative to C 
major, you can stay in key by playing in C major. To achieve a cohesive sound, you will have to treat 
F as your root. There is a lot more to modal improvisation, but this is a good start.

This process will allow you to reuse pre-existing knowledge to improvise modally, rather than learning 
a completely new series of shapes for each mode.

## Melodic and Harmonic Minor
Everything mentioned above applies to both the melodic and harmonic minor scales. If you consider both 
of these scales as alterations to the minor scale, which itself is just a mode of the major scale, you
can again reuse shapes you already know with some slight modifications. 

The modes of the melodic minor scale are as follows:
- Melodic minor 
- Dorian b2 
- Lydian augmented
- Lydian dominant 
- Mixolydian b6
- Aeolian b5 
- Altered 

And the harmonic minor scale:
- Harmonic Minor
- Locrian Natural 6 
- Ionian Augmented 
- Dorian #11 
- Phrygian Dominant 
- Lydian #9 
- Ultralocrian 

Apply the same concepts as we did for the modes of the major scale, but correspond each of these modes with 
the notes of some harmonic/melodic minor scale. I plan to eventually go into more depth on this topic, maybe 
with a video guide.
