  <div class="single-content">
    <p>This article aims to shed some light on the process of learning the guitar, broadly. By anticipating the
highs and lows, you will dramatically increase the likelihood of &lsquo;success&rsquo;, whatever that means to you.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-decide">Before you decide</h2>
<p>If you are unsure if you should pick up a guitar in the first place, consider the following:</p>
<h3 id="can-you-afford-it">Can you afford it?</h3>
<p>£100 is the bare minimum I suggest spending on your first guitar. Anything less than that may leave
you with an instrument not fit for purpose, dramatically reducing the rate at which you progress. Spending
£100 doesn&rsquo;t guarantee anything, but it definitely shifts the odds in your favour. If you don&rsquo;t mind spending
an additional £75/100, you&rsquo;ll be able to get a much nicer guitar.</p>
<p>Avoid buying anything online, and try to find someone qualified to give their opinion before you spend your money.
If anyone you know plays the guitar, ask if they&rsquo;ll come to your local guitar shop with you. If this isn&rsquo;t possible,
the shop&rsquo;s staff will be more than happy to help. Ask if they have anything secondhand under £200, and see if anything
catches your eye. Make sure to say that you aren&rsquo;t worried about tone, just playability.</p>
<p>I suggest looking for an <em>electric</em> guitar, unless you specifically want to play acoustic. In my experience,
cheaper acoustic guitars are typically much harder to play than their electric counterparts. It isn&rsquo;t entirely
necessary to buy an amplifier with your electric guitar, but it is something to consider. You&rsquo;ll need to buy a travel
case if your guitar will be leaving the house. Instead of buying a physical guitar tuner, there are plenty of apps
that do the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-the-time">Do you have the time?</h3>
<p>20 minutes a day, every day. As you progress, you&rsquo;ll naturally want to increase this to 30+ minutes. This, however, is
much easier said than done. Life is unpredictable, things will inevitably get in the way of your plans.</p>
<p>Will you be motivated enough after a long day of work to pick up your guitar? Will you be able to wake up just that little
bit earlier to squeeze in a bit of practice? Practice shouldn&rsquo;t be a chore, or you will grow to resent it. It needs to be a
regular part of your routine.</p>
<h3 id="why-specifically-the-guitar">Why specifically the guitar?</h3>
<p>People decide to learn the guitar for a range of reasons. Ask yourself what your reasons are, and whether or not something
else could work for you. The guitar has a steep initial learning curve, and many people give up very quickly. Would a more
forgiving instrument scratch that same itch?</p>
<p>A passion for music helps a <em>lot</em>. <em>Specifically</em> guitar-centric music. Being able to play something that matters to you is
a great motivator. Create a setlist of your favourite songs, and work through each of them. If you think any of it is too
difficult, move on to something easier and return when you&rsquo;re ready. A lot of your progress will come from learning how
to play other peoples&rsquo; music, so having a broad taste is very helpful.</p>
<p>If you listen mostly to classical music, you&rsquo;ll probably want to learn to play the piano, violin or cello. Rock music? Guitar,
bass or drums. Make sure your decisions line up with your preferences. You would be shocked how many students I have had who
literally couldn&rsquo;t name a single band they enjoyed listening to.</p>
