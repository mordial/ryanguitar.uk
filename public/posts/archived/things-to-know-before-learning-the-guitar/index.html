<h2 id="things-to-not-neglect">Things to not neglect</h2>
<p>I think there are a few things that every fledgling guitarist needs to consider. They are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You get what you pay for</h3>
<p>You may have heard people argue that a true professional will never blame their equipment. At this
point, you are <em>not</em> a professional. I&rsquo;ve had dozens of students arrive with
guitars that are absolutely not fit for purpose. In the hands of a better player it might
not matter as much, but beginners need all the help they can get. People often don&rsquo;t even
realise when something is wrong. Look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>String action. The distance between your strings and your fretboard.</li>
<li>String age. If your strings feel or look dirty, they&rsquo;re probably too old.</li>
<li>Fret buzz. Notes that buzz no matter what you do.</li>
</ul>
<p>These things will make your life a lot harder. If you think you have any of these problems,
take your guitar to a local repair shop and see if they can help you out.
A cheaper guitar will feel worse to play than a more expensive one, generally speaking. It&rsquo;s difficult
to justify spending a lot of money on a hobby you aren&rsquo;t entirely sure you&rsquo;ll be able to commit to, but
simply spending £200 rather than £120 can make a massive difference to the quality of your instrument.
I suggest spending more of your budget on the guitar, and less on accessories/amps. Speaking of which:</p>
<h3 id="dont-obsess-over-gear">Don&rsquo;t obsess over gear</h3>
<p>There is a minimum bar that needs to be met so that your gear doesn&rsquo;t impede your progress. Anything more
than that should be considered a luxury, and as such isn&rsquo;t entirely necessary. This bar will absolutely
increase over time. You will start to need better and better gear to improve. Don&rsquo;t preoccupy yourself with what
kind of guitar, amp, or pedals you have unless it&rsquo;s getting in your way. Avoid jealousy, too. Guitars can get
<a href="https://www.guitarworld.com/features/most-expensive-guitars-sold-at-auction" target="_blank" ><em>expensive</em></a>.</p>
<h3 id="learn-about-your-instrument">Learn about your instrument</h3>
<p>You should know as much about your instrument as possible. Learn what every part is called. learn how
many frets your specific guitar has. Learn what the model of your guitar is. How do you tune the guitar?
How do the different pickup options sound? What kind of pickups do you have?</p>
<h3 id="learn-how-to-look-after-your-instrument">Learn how to look after your instrument</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to save some money, it may be worth learning how to restring your guitar. There are small
adjustments that you may want to make over time. When you have a large enough guitar collection it becomes
quite important to know how to look after them. I&rsquo;ve change strings hundred of times, polished frets,
adjusted neck relief. Later down the line you may even need to do some electrical work. I left one of
my guitars unplayed for over a year because I didn&rsquo;t know how to solder the input jack. After eventually
biting the bullet and doing some research, it turned out to be a lot easier than I was expecting.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-learning-curve">The learning curve</h2>
<p>You may have heard people refer to &ldquo;hitting a wall&rdquo; while learning guitar. It can be disheartening to
feel like you&rsquo;ve lost momentum, but this is experience is quite universal. The guitar has a very sporadic
learning curve; sometimes you can go quite a while without <em>feeling</em> like you&rsquo;ve made any progress.</p>
<h3 id="the-early-bump">The early bump</h3>
<p>The early stages of the guitar learning curve can be quite steep. There&rsquo;s quite a bit of work to be done
before you get perceived results, particularly when compared with other more accessible instruments. Consider
the piano. You push down a key and hear a note. The note will always sound just about the same, no matter
where you push down on the key, which finger you use, etc. This concept is easy to grasp, and allows
people to very quickly play a song that they can recognize. On the guitar, there are a few more things
to consider before you can play even a single note. The note can sound muted if you apply too little
pressure, it can buzz if your finger is too close to the previous fret. It could even sound slightly too
sharp if you push down <em>too</em> hard or bend the string. Digging your finger into a string made of wound steel,
believe it or not, can also be quite painful if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>
<h3 id="the-intermediate-wall">The intermediate wall</h3>
<p>This will become more relevant later in your journey, but is worth keeping in mind. After a few years
of playing, you may feel like quite the capable guitarist. Naturally at this point, you&rsquo;ll be thinking
of what you need to do to reach the next level and become an <em>advanced</em> player. You figure out what
you need to do, and get to work. After some time you begin to feel like it just isn&rsquo;t working out.
You feel like you&rsquo;ve done everything you can, but this is it. You&rsquo;ve peaked. I know the feeling. The
truth is that you just need to keep on going. Keep trying, and don&rsquo;t give up. You&rsquo;ll break through
eventually. Trust the process.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-fear-the-unknown">Do not fear the unknown</h3>
<p>Many people avoid learning theory. Why? They think it&rsquo;s a lot harder than it really is. Replace &ldquo;theory&rdquo;
with virtually anything else, and the point still stands. It&rsquo;s very likely that the thing you&rsquo;re avoiding
learning about is actually a lot more straightforward than you think. It&rsquo;s like what I mentioned previously
about learning how to solder. Had I overcome my apprehension, I would have been able to play my guitar much
sooner. Instead it hung on my wall for over a year. There&rsquo;s no harm in trying, you just need to know when
you&rsquo;re wasting your time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>There is a great deal of information online about learning the guitar, and a lot of it is bad. Every
song has many different interpretations created by hobbyists transcribers, so how can you tell which
one is correct? Spotting a bad transcription is a skill in itself, and something that should be kept
in mind as you develop as a musician. If something doesn&rsquo;t sound right, <em>it probably isn&rsquo;t</em>.</p>
<h3 id="tabs">Tabs</h3>
<p>Guitar tablature is a kind of notation specific to instruments with strings and frets. It is intuitive and
very accessible for beginners. Some forms of tablature omit rhythmic information, expecting the reader to
intuit the rhythm by listening to the piece they are attempting to learn. Other forms of tabs include rhythmic
information and even allow playback. Generally speaking, I suggest using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.songsterr.com/" target="_blank" >Songsterr</a> for free tablature</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/" target="_blank" >UltimateGuitar</a> for chord progressions (for the most part)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.sheethappenspublishing.com/" target="_blank" >SheetHappens</a> for official paid transcriptions (limited bands)</li>
</ul>
<p>UltimateGuitar can be very useful, but be weary. There tend to be many different versions of each song,
and the site constantly tries to sell you their premium service or get you to make an account. When searching
for songs, the top of the results list will be &ldquo;official&rdquo; or &ldquo;pro&rdquo; versions which are locked behind a paywall. I also
find that the UI is clunky and outdated.</p>
<h3 id="courses-and-videos">Courses and videos</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably seen dozens of courses and masterclasses being sold by various guitar players online. Unless
you are absolutely certain you will benefit from buying the course, you should avoid spending your money.
If the guitarist happens to be a person you are specifically interested in and who plays in a way that you
are otherwise unable to understand, feel free to check the course out. Most of these courses are rather
expensive and completely unnecessary. If you see a course that claims to have all the answers, it doesn&rsquo;t. There
is no big secret. The secret is hard work and patience. There are also plenty of Youtube videos showcasing how
to play certain songs and explaining certain music-related concepts. While these are generally quite good on the
whole, I would still be cautious. A lot of things in music can be referred to with several different words, which
can be extremely confusing for a beginner. Semi Quaver? 16th note? Fretboard? Fingerboard?</p>
<h3 id="private-tuition">Private tuition</h3>
<p>I have a potentially unique take when it comes to private tuition. I have never personally had a guitar teacher.
When I started teaching, I was reminded of every roadblock I had once hit and the effort it took me to
eventually overcome them. Had I had a teacher, maybe I would have ended up getting stuck less often.
A good teacher will also be able to inform you more about everything I&rsquo;ve mentioned in the article
so far. I try all of my students&rsquo; guitars and tell them if anything can be adjusted to make their lives
easier. I tell them when I think it&rsquo;s time for them to upgrade, or to change their strings. I suggest specific
guitars considering their budgets, tastes and musical interests. We exchange music recommendations
and I suggest songs for them to learn. There is a lot of give and take in the relationship between a student and
their teacher. The most successful students are honest and enthusiastic, keen to learn and brimming with unanswered
questions. If that&rsquo;s you, consider private tuition.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="managing-expectations">Managing expectations</h2>
<p>People pick up a guitar and expect to be able to play like their heroes in a couple of years. Unfortunately,
this couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. Nobody is ever finished learning how to play the guitar, and it may take
<em>years</em> for you to achieve your goals.</p>
<h3 id="dont-set-deadlines">Don&rsquo;t set deadlines</h3>
<p>There is absolutely no way to tell how long it will take you to be able to do any one specific thing with guitar,
particularly if you&rsquo;re a beginner. If asked how long I might take to learn a song, I could make an educated
guess. This would be informed by how long it has taken me to learn other songs of a similar difficulty. If asked
how long it might take a complete stranger with no experience to master barre chords, my guess would be far less
accurate. I&rsquo;ve seen people manage them in a couple of months, and others a couple of years. The difference is
likely in the amount of practice being done, the type of practice being done, and some other factors out of
anyone&rsquo;s control. Which is why I also believe it&rsquo;s important that you:</p>
<h3 id="dont-compare-yourself-to-anyone-else">Don&rsquo;t compare yourself to anyone else</h3>
<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve taught people with missing and broken fingers, people with learning difficulties, people
with perfect pitch, people with freakishly long fingers, the list goes on. It is not possible to compare yourself
objectively to any one person, and more importantly it is not helpful. More often than not you won&rsquo;t know the full
picture. It could be the case that they&rsquo;ve managed to practice an hour a day every day for 30 years and have
been playing since they were 5. What kind of comparison is that? The most important comparison you can make is
between you and yourself. What can you do today that you couldn&rsquo;t do yesterday? Last week? Last year? It&rsquo;s important
to track your progress, and eventually:</p>
<h3 id="celebrate-the-milestones-big-and-small">Celebrate the milestones, big and small</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to celebrate the small victories. What exactly constitutes a victory for you? Playing that one
very difficult song at 70% speed, when you were only playing at 50% speed last week? Being able to play that one
scale from memory without any mistakes? Define exactly what you want to do and create a roadmap. How do you get from
where you are today to where you want to be? Be kind to yourself and set realistic goals. The short term victories are
perhaps more important than the bigger picture. How do you know which goals to set? Well:</p>
<h3 id="look-for-inspiration">Look for inspiration</h3>
<p>Surround yourself with guitar related content and guitar-centric music. I started listening to and studying a large
amount of guitar instrumentals as I transitioned from beginner to intermediate. I started paying for official tab
books and working through complex pieces to hone my skills as much as I could. I expanded my music taste and started
thinking about how I might begin to write music myself. I grew more and more interested in individual guitarists
and what makes them unique. In all honesty, I only really started teaching myself about music theory when I decided
I wanted to become a guitar teacher. I had spent 6 to 7 years doing nothing but learning how to play songs of
increasing difficulty. Songs that I really enjoyed listening to, songs that still give me <em>goosebumps</em>. I started a
vinyl collection, started going to gigs and festivals. Allow yourself to be completely absorbed by your love of music
and let it translate into a dedication to improvement.</p>
