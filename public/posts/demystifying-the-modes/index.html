finally get up there on the bandstand, forget all that and just wail.&rdquo; - Charlie Parker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to learn scales across the entire fretboard before you can articulate any ideas you may have.
It&rsquo;s true that there are no right answers when it comes to music, but you must first learn how to play
&lsquo;inside&rsquo; if you want to play &lsquo;outside&rsquo; successfully.</p>
<p>Before you attempt to play modally, you must know the major scale across the entire fretboard. This can
be done by memorizing three shapes.</p>
<p>










<figure class="">

    <div>
        <img loading="lazy" alt="F major" src=" /img/demystifying-the-modes/f-major.png">
    </div>

    
</figure></p>
<p>This diagram shows a fretboard with every note in the key of F major highlighted. The three shapes you
want to learn are between
frets <a href="/fretboard/?startFret=1&amp;endFret=5&amp;scale=f&#43;major" >1 and 5</a>,
frets <a href="/fretboard/?startFret=6&amp;endFret=10&amp;scale=f&#43;major" >6 and 10</a>, and
frets <a href="/fretboard/?startFret=10&amp;endFret=14&amp;scale=f&#43;major" >10 and 14</a>.
Notice that the first shape is <em>not</em> connected to the second shape, but the second shape <em>is</em> connected to
the third. After the 12th fret, the pattern repeats. If the shapes are played from top to bottom, you will
run into certain spots where you end up playing the same note twice. This is fine, as we want to know where
every available note is.</p>
<p>This approach to memorizing the major scale is essentially identical to how people generally learn
every position of the minor pentatonic scale. The only difference is that in this case, you learn 3
shapes rather than 5.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve memorized these shapes, you need to wrap your head around the relationship between the major
scale and its modes.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-modes">What are the modes?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>I don&rsquo;t particularly like modes a lot</strong>&rdquo; - A useful mnemonic device for memorizing the order of the modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are seven modes of the major scale, one for each of its notes. These modes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ionian</li>
<li>Dorian</li>
<li>Phrygian</li>
<li>Lydian</li>
<li>Mixolydian</li>
<li>Aeolian</li>
<li>Locrian</li>
</ol>
<p>Remembering them in this specific order is critically important. Ionian is the unchanged major scale, which
you should now know how to play all across the fretboard. The other modes are all just slight modifications
to the major scale. Conveniently, it&rsquo;s entirely possible to play modally without even knowing which notes
have been modified.</p>
<h3 id="the-standard-learning-process">The standard learning process</h3>
<p>Typically, people will be taught which notes have been modified for each mode. Lydian will be thought of as
a major scale with a sharpened 4th. The <code>F</code> in <a href="/fretboard/?scale=c&#43;major" >C major</a> becomes an <code>F#</code> in
<a href="/fretboard/?scale=c&#43;lydian" >C lydian</a>. This seems simple enough, until you start trying to apply this rule
across the entire fretboard every time you come across that modified tone.</p>
<p>You will eventually have to learn 7 totally different fretboards, or at least 7 alternate versions of the
shapes you used to memorize the major scale. This is unreasonable and unnecessary. You need only understand
where the modes come from to know why.</p>
<h3 id="my-approach">My approach</h3>
<p>The modes should be remembered in a particular order for a very good reason. Take the scale <code>G</code> major for
example. It&rsquo;s notes are <code>G A B C D E F#</code>. There are 6 other scales, each of a different mode, that share the
exact same notes as G major. These are known as &ldquo;relative&rdquo; scales.</p>
<p>The second note in <code>G</code> major is <code>A</code>, and the 2nd mode is dorian. <code>A</code> dorian shares all of <code>G</code> major&rsquo;s notes.
The third note is <code>B</code>, the third mode is phrygian, and the same idea applies. Follow that same principal, and
try entering each scale into my <a href="/fretboard" >visualizer</a> to see exactly what I mean. You&rsquo;ll notice that none
of the notes on the fretboard actually move, only which note is highlighted as the root.</p>
