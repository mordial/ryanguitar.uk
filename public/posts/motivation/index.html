<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been playing the guitar for about 11 years. I was given a guitar for christmas when I was
8 years old, but was only entertained for about 2 days. Around the age of 14 I began to develop
a serious interest in music, and started listening to a lot thrash metal and nu metal. I was given
a cheap Toys-R-Us CBSKY stratocaster knockoff that christmas, and couldn&rsquo;t be happier. I started
teaching myself how to play songs using tabs I found online. I never had any lessons, and didn&rsquo;t
study music at school. Here I am 11 years later, with a wealth of anecdotes to share about the process
of learning how to play the guitar.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="things-not-to-neglect">Things not to neglect</h2>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s easy to take shortcuts. Sometimes they can really impede your progress down the line.</p>
<h3 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You get what you pay for</h3>
<p>You may have heard people argue that a true professional will never blame their equipment. At this
point, you are <em>not</em> a professional. I have had dozens of students arrive to their lessons with
guitars that are absolutely not fit for purpose. In the hands of a truly great player it might
not be that big of a deal, but as a beginner, you need all the help you can get. It doesn&rsquo;t help
that a beginner doesn&rsquo;t necessarily know that anything is wrong. Look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>String action. The distance between your strings and your fretboard.</li>
<li>String age. If you strings feel or look dirty, they&rsquo;re probably too old.</li>
<li>Fret buzz. Do certain notes buzz no matter what you do?</li>
</ul>
<p>These things will definitely make your life a lot harder. If you think you have any of these problems,
take your guitar to a local repair shop and see if they can help you out.</p>
<h3 id="learn-about-your-instrument">Learn about your instrument</h3>
<p>You should know as much about your instrument as possible. Learn what every part is called. learn how
many frets your specific guitar has. Learn what the model of your guitar is. How do you tune the guitar?
How do the different pickup options sound? What kind of pickups do you have?</p>
<h3 id="learn-how-to-look-after-your-instrument">Learn how to look after your instrument</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to save some money, it may be worth learning how to restring your guitar. There are small
adjustments that you may want to make over time. When you have a large enough guitar collection it becomes
quite important to know how to look after them. I&rsquo;ve change strings hundred of times, polished frets,
adjusted neck relief. Later down the line you may even need to do some electrical work. I left one of
my guitars unplayed for over a year because I didn&rsquo;t know how to solder the input jack. After eventually
biting the bullet and doing some research, it turned out to be a lot easier than I was expecting.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-learning-curve">The learning curve</h2>
<p>You may have heard people refer to &ldquo;hitting a wall&rdquo; while learning guitar. It can be disheartening to
feel like you&rsquo;ve lost momentum, but this is just the way learning guitar is. It has a very sporadic
learning curve; sometimes you can go quite a while without feeling like you&rsquo;re making any progress.</p>
<h3 id="the-early-bump">The early bump</h3>
<p>The early stages of the guitar learning curve can be quite steep. There&rsquo;s quite a bit of work to be done
before you get real results, particularly when compared with other more accessible instruments. Consider
the piano. You push down a key and hear a note. The note will always sound just about the same, no matter
where you push down on the key, which finger you use, etc. This concept is easy to grasp, and allows
people to very quickly play a song that they can recognize. On the guitar, there is a lot more that can
go wrong. The note can sound muted if you apply too little pressure, it can buzz if your finger is too
close to the previous fret. Digging your finger into a string made of wound steel, believe it or not,
can also be quite painful if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>
<h3 id="the-intermediate-wall">The intermediate wall</h3>
<p>This will become more relevant later in your journey, but is worth keeping in mind. After a few years
of playing, you may feel like quite the capable guitarist. Naturally at this point, you&rsquo;ll be thinking
of what you need to do to reach the next level and become an <em>advanced</em> player. You figure out what
you need to do, and get to work. After some time you begin to feel like it just isn&rsquo;t working out.
You feel like you&rsquo;ve done everything you can, but this is it. You&rsquo;ve peaked. I know the feeling. The
truth is that you just need to keep on going. Keep trying, and don&rsquo;t give up. You&rsquo;ll break through
eventually. Trust the process.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-fear-the-unknown">Do not fear the unknown</h3>
<p>Many people avoid learning theory. Why? They think it&rsquo;s a lot harder than it really is. Replace &ldquo;theory&rdquo;
with virtually anything else, and the point still stands. It&rsquo;s very likely that the thing you&rsquo;re avoiding
learning about is actually a lot more straightforward than you think. It&rsquo;s like what I mentioned previously
about learning how to solder. Had I overcome my apprehension, I would have been able to play my guitar much
sooner. Instead it hung on my wall for over a year. If you avoid learning a particular song because you
don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll be able to play it, you will never be able to play it. There&rsquo;s no harm in trying.</p>
