    <p>My students often consult me before making any guitar related purchases. I&rsquo;ve never considered myself to be an
expert on guitar gear, so tend to only suggest things I&rsquo;m familiar with. In this post, I&rsquo;ll talk briefly about
all of my equipment, weighing up the pros and cons to each.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>As of right now I own:</p>
<ul>
<li>7 guitars</li>
<li>3 pedals</li>
<li>1 amplifier</li>
</ul>
<p>Many guitarists have a much more extensive collection. I have a fair few students who own more pedals or guitars
than me. Noteworthy guitars are:</p>
<h3 id="fender-american-special-telecaster">Fender American Special Telecaster</h3>
<p>I bought this guitar on <a href="https://www.reverb.com" target="_blank" >Reverb</a> in 2023. It was made in the US in 2012, and is probably
the guitar that I play the most. It&rsquo;s worth about £1000, and feels every bit as premium as you would hope. It is
definitely the most versatile guitar I own, capable of anything from jazz to metal.</p>
<h3 id="fender-stratocaster-st-54-cij">Fender Stratocaster ST-54 CIJ</h3>
<p>I traded for this guitar in 2024. CIJ means &lsquo;Crafted in Japan&rsquo;, which it was in 1998. It&rsquo;s a 1954 reissue with a
V neck profile, making it quite clubby. I had never played a guitar like it, and knew quickly that I had to have it.
I had a guitar of similar value sitting around collecting dust, so offered to trade. Accurately assessing its value
is tricky because they don&rsquo;t sell very often, but I&rsquo;d estimate it to be worth from £750 to £1000.</p>
<h3 id="epiphone-sheraton-ii-pro">Epiphone Sheraton-II PRO</h3>
<p>I got this guitar in 2023. It was made in Korea in 2005. It plays and sounds great, and can be picked up
around the £600 mark.</p>
<h3 id="ibanez-rgaix-7fm">Ibanez RGAIX-7FM</h3>
<p>I bought this 7 string Ibanez in 2017 with my first ever paycheque. I had started my first job the day after I turned
18 and knew exactly what I wanted to buy: A Chapman Ghost Fret. So why did I end up with an Ibanez? I went to Anderton&rsquo;s
in Guildford to try out some guitars, and decided that the Ghost Fret just wasn&rsquo;t for me. It didn&rsquo;t feel quite right,
especially not for £1000. After looking around and trying out some other 7 string guitars, I settled on the Ibanez.
I bought it brand new for £800, and you can grab one used today for around £650 - if you can find one. This model was
discontinue in 2019, so can&rsquo;t be bought new.</p>
<h3 id="gretsch-g5260-electromatic-jet-baritone">Gretsch G5260 Electromatic Jet Baritone</h3>
<p>I always wanted to get a baritone guitar, but struggled to find any for a reasonable price. I wasn&rsquo;t committed enough
to spend a lot, so seeing one of these on reverb for £350 piqued my interest. I got it in 2023, and put on the thickest
strings I possibly could. I keep it tuned to F standard (11 semitones down) and use it almost exclusively to cover songs
that would otherwise require 8 strings. It doubles as a bass VI in a pinch.</p>
