    <blockquote>
<p>“Be your own artist, and always be confident in what you’re doing.
If you’re not going to be confident, you might as well not be doing it.” – Aretha Franklin</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This article aims to shed some light on the process of learning the guitar, broadly. By anticipating the
highs and lows, you will dramatically increase the likelihood of &lsquo;success&rsquo;, whatever that means to you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="before-you-decide">Before you decide</h2>
<p>Starting your journey can be a daunting prospect. To help relieve some of the burden, I&rsquo;ve put together
a list of basic considerations that everyone should make.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-are-you-willing-to-spend">How much are you willing to spend?</h3>
<p>£100 is the bare minimum I suggest spending on your first guitar. Anything less than that may leave
you with an instrument not fit for purpose, dramatically reducing the rate at which you progress. Spending
£100 doesn&rsquo;t guarantee anything, but it definitely shifts the odds in your favour. If you don&rsquo;t mind spending
an additional £75/100, you&rsquo;ll be able to get a much nicer guitar.</p>
<p>Avoid buying anything online, and try to find someone qualified to give their opinion before you spend your money.
If anyone you know plays the guitar, ask if they&rsquo;ll come to your local guitar shop with you. If this isn&rsquo;t possible,
the shop&rsquo;s staff will be more than happy to help. Ask if they have anything secondhand under £200, and see if anything
catches your eye. Make sure to say that you aren&rsquo;t worried about tone, just playability.</p>
<p>I suggest looking for an <em>electric</em> guitar, unless you specifically want to play acoustic. In my experience,
cheaper acoustic guitars are typically much harder to play than their electric counterparts. It isn&rsquo;t entirely
necessary to buy an amplifier with your electric guitar, but it is something to consider. You&rsquo;ll need to buy a travel
case if your guitar will be leaving the house. Instead of buying a physical guitar tuner, there are plenty of apps
that do the same thing.</p>
<p>There are other optional costs associated with playing the guitar, from private tuition to effects pedals. Accessories
and hardware will accumulate over time, and lessons (while helpful) are entirely optional. As with most things in life,
money helps. For now, you need only consider the cost of entry.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-the-time">Do you have the time?</h3>
<p>20 minutes a day, every day. As you progress, you&rsquo;ll naturally want to increase this to 30+ minutes. This, however, is
much easier said than done. Life is unpredictable, things will inevitably get in the way of your plans.</p>
<p>Will you be motivated enough after a long day of work to pick up your guitar? Will you be able to wake up just that little
bit earlier to squeeze in a bit of practice? Practice shouldn&rsquo;t be a chore, or you will grow to resent it. It needs to be a
regular part of your routine.</p>
<h3 id="why-specifically-the-guitar">Why specifically the guitar?</h3>
<p>People decide to learn the guitar for a range of reasons. Ask yourself what your reasons are, and whether or not something
else could work for you. The guitar has a steep initial learning curve, and many people give up very quickly. Would a more
forgiving instrument scratch that same itch?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Music is a necessity. After food, air, water and warmth, music is the next necessity of life.” - Keith Richards</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A passion for music helps a <em>lot</em>. <em>Specifically</em> guitar-centric music. Being able to play something that matters to you is
a great motivator. Create a setlist of your favourite songs, and work through each of them. If you think any of it is too
difficult, move on to something easier and return when you&rsquo;re ready. A lot of your progress will come from learning how
to play other peoples&rsquo; music, so having a broad taste is very helpful.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-early-stages">The early stages</h2>
<p>As I mentioned previously, the guitar has a steep initial learning curve. Compared to other instruments, initial progress
can feel slow. As a result, the early stages are critically important, and can make or break a guitarist.</p>
<h3 id="effective-practice">Effective practice</h3>
<p>Simply practicing isn&rsquo;t enough. You need to practice <em>correctly</em>. The earlier you start doing this, the better. Absolute
beginners won&rsquo;t need to warm up, or follow a rigid structure, but this will become more and more necessary the better you
become. All you need to do is work towards a specific goal, and track how close you are to hitting it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Practice does not make perfect. Only perfect practice makes perfect.&rdquo; — Vince Lombardi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your goal should be realistic and not <em>too</em> ambitious, learning a handful of riffs from a song for example. I define
&ldquo;learning&rdquo; at this stage as being able to play something from memory at the original recorded tempo. As you progress,
you may want to add more to this definition. Over time, you will learn <em>how</em> to practice. You need to be able to
articulate exactly what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve, and how your methodology is going to achieve it. It is important
to create this habit early, and carry it on into the future.</p>
<h3 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h3>
<p>You should learn how to read chord diagrams and tablature as quickly as possible. You shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay for anything;
most of what you&rsquo;ll want to learn can be found online for free. You can search for chords and tabs online using sites such
as <a href="https://ultimate-guitar.com" target="_blank" >Ultimate Guitar</a>, <a href="https://songsterr.com" target="_blank" >Songsterr</a> and <a href="https://soundslice.com" target="_blank" >Soundslice</a>.
In fact, I don&rsquo;t recommend any other sites for chords and tabs. You can also find plenty of tutorials for free on
<a href="https://youtbube.com" target="_blank" >Youtube</a>.</p>
<p>If your financial situation permits it, you should consider private tuition. A professional can point out your mistakes and
suggest exercises and pieces for you to learn. Weekly structured lessons will help maximize the effectiveness of your practice
sessions, and help keep you focused on playing. A teacher will be much better at keeping track of your progress, and will provide
feedback and motivation that you wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="managing-expectations">Managing expectations</h3>
<p>You will need to persist and be patient. Again, the guitar has a steep initial learning curve. It may be frustrating, tiresome,
even physically painful. You don&rsquo;t just <em>learn</em> the guitar, you <em>earn</em> the guitar. You have to be prepared to struggle through
for a while without any clear results. If you are motivated by results, this will be tough.</p>
<p>Your first victory could be playing a single note clearly without any buzzing, or playing a chord without accidentally muting any
of your strings. It will feel underwhelming and disproportionately difficult, but that&rsquo;s the nature of playing the guitar. This will
pass, and you will soon be able to get on with actually playing music.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="into-the-future">Into the future</h2>
<p>As you develop into an intermediate/advanced level player, you may run into some more complex issues. This may be a good few years
down the line, but is definitely worth considering as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="hitting-a-wall">Hitting a wall</h3>
<p>Guitarists will typically hit a wall at some point. Suddenly their progress will halt, for seemingly no reason at all. This is
completely normal, and should be expected. Your development will not be linear, some goals will take longer to reach than others.
The solution here is to persevere and trust the process that has taken you so far.</p>
<p>Simply knowing that you aren&rsquo;t alone in this experience could mean all the difference. I&rsquo;m sure many guitarists have hit a wall
at some point and decided that was their limit. In reality, the only limits you have are the ones you set yourself. I&rsquo;ve hit many
walls, and each time refused to give up and eventually broken through.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-goals">Long term goals</h3>
<p>I generally believe there are only a few paths that musicians can go down later in life. You may develop a love for the very act
of <em>playing</em> the guitar, and become an amazing improviser in the privacy of your own home. It can be very therapeutic to throw on
a backing track and play whatever comes to you. Then again, you may decide that you want to actually create music of your own. If
this sounds like something you might be interested in, even this early, you should start preparations as soon as possible.</p>
<p>A lot of people prefer the idea of creating music alone. In this case, you&rsquo;ll want to look into music production as you develop
your technical ability. You&rsquo;ll also want to learn about composition and other related music theory. You may prefer the idea of
playing in a band with other people, in which case you&rsquo;ll want to look for other musicians. A large number of bands are formed in
educational institutions. If you&rsquo;re young enough, and dedicated enough, you may want to study music at school. This will allow you
to meet other musicians and find people with similar tastes. If you attend a university, consider joining the music society to meet
more musicians.</p>
<p>You may also be interested in getting into education. This could be teaching music generally, or specializing in a particular
instrument. If this is the case, you should approach learning your instrument more studiously. Imagine any question a student could
possibly bring to you, and ensure that you have the answer.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Ultimately, you will get out as much as you put in. If you truly love the guitar, and feel you can devote enough time to your
craft, you will see results. It is important to never compare yourself to any other person when honing a skill. The only healthy
competition you can have is with <em>yourself</em>. How far have <em>you</em> come in the last month? The last year? If you haven&rsquo;t come as far
as you would have liked, could you have practiced more? Were you practicing as efficiently as you could have? Try to be as fair as
possible with yourself, but don&rsquo;t be complacent. Consider your initial motivations and above all else, be prepared.</p>
